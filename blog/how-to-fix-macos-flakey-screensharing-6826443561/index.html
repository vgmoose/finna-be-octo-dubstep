        <h2>How to fix macOS Flakey Screensharing</h2>
        <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> for flakiness in Messages screen sharing, run the command at the bottom of this post</p>
<p>The screen sharing functionality in macOS is really good!... When it works! I've been using it for a really long time<br />
now, and they seem to continuously change how you access/use it. In the early days, it could be accessed through<br />
AIM and iChat, if both parties had a Mac. In the buddy list, this would be denoted with a video chat icon that<br />
showed little screens behind it.</p>
<p>As Apple upgraded the operating system, Messages replaced iChat, and they slowly ripped out the support for<br />
other non-iMessage accounts. The screen sharing functionality however, is still there!</p>
<p>In order to screen share with someone else on macOS, it seems that all of the following needs to be true:<br />
1. You are both signed into an iMessage-capable apple ID in the following places: System Preferences (under Account), FaceTime, and Messages (yes all three)<br />
2. You both add each other as a contact (Can be done in Messages)<br />
3. One person initiates it via the far-left icon in the  "Details" menu in the upper right in the Conversation in Messages</p>
<p>If the option is presented, there are two choices: "Invite to Share My Screen" and "Ask to Share Screen". These are great!<br />
Very often, you'll want to screen share with someone who doesn't really know the feature exists, and "Ask to Share Screen" is a great<br />
way to get connected faster without them worrying about finding the setting. The problem, however, is what happens <em>after</em> that.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, after choosing one of the two selections, there is no visible indicator of the pending invitation. Sometimes there is, but<br />
soemtimes there isn't. Then, if they don't answer the call in a specific amount of time, the pending invitation disappears, and neither<br />
party has any idea what the status of the invite is. Despite this though, trying to re-invite won't work.</p>
<p>There are seemingly a number of reasons it can get stuck like this. The ultimate result is one party never sees the invitation and subsequent<br />
invites don't work. Then <em>no matter what you do</em> you can't enter a screen sharing session anymore. Usually both people have to end up rebooting<br />
to fix this problem.</p>
<p>I know this all sounds strange and specific, but having used many different Macs with many different people throughout the years, this has been<br />
a consistent issue. It's very frustrating, especially because of how <em>good</em> the screen sharing functionality is when it works! It's byfar<br />
better than Hangouts, Zoom, or Skype screen sharing.</p>
<p>So, this brings me to the "solution", which is more of a "Let's restart everything that might have even a little to do with screen sharing".</p>
<p>Executing this command as follows, and entering the password, in the Terminal app:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>sudo killall SSInvitationAgent imagent VDCAssistant &quot;Screen Sharing&quot; Messages   </code></pre>


<p>It probably kills more than it has to, but in my experience, if screen sharing flakiness is experienced, and both parties run the above, things magically resume working!</p>
<p>I wish Apple would advertise more this screen sharing feature, and iron out any issues/bugs with the connection. It could be a really cool<br />
selling point of Macs to get screen sharing up and running so quickly via iMessage! They have all the pieces, and it's sad that it's<br />
not seen as a more user-friendly/appealing feature. Instead it's tucked away inside Messages which has already become a shell of what it was when it was branded as iChat.</p>
<p>Final ranting point: Now that iTunes is split up into three apps: Music, TV, and Podcasts, it's sad that playing content in one doesn't pause the other. There are strange "design" choices like this all over the OS that I hope they can figure out! Maybe eventual integration with iOS will fix some of this (for instance, on iOS no issues with pausing other media when another one starts playing!)</p>
