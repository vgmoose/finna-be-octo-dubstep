A couple of friends and I are looking at developing a full fledged game for the iPod Touch. Although we can't really talk about it much right now for the sake of spoiling you children, there's a lot to go on and it sounds pretty awesome. We're talking cutscenes. CUTSCENES MAN!!

You can expect a free demo sometime around the end of the Summer. The actual game, when it comes out, is planned to be sold for $3.00 on the AppStore, and for $2.00 to Jailbroken users (screw apple, lol). It's a really small fee. I know, I also hate it when people charge for things, but being on the other side of the fence, ME NEEDS MONEY, and 2 or 3 dollars really isn't that much AT ALL.
