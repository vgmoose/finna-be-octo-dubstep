These are patches for Red/Blue that are built with their music tempo slowed down 2x and 4x. This is done by changing [this line](https://github.com/pret/pokered/blob/bbb0e7e82deb6741f75a12b48f81076d92f5d9dc/macros/scripts/audio.asm#L172) in the decompilation (to `HIGH(\1 * 2), LOW(\1 * 2)` or `HIGH(\1 * 4), LOW(\1) * 4`).

This creates a slightly better experience if you use 2x or 4x speed up / fast forwarding in an emulator, so that the sound isn't just a cacophony of sped up noises. It's not perfect though!
