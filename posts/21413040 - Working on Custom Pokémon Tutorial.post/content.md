As you may have, but probably didn’t notice, there’s a new tutorial entry under the tutorials page. It partially details how to insert your own custom Pokémon into the game. It’s a work in progress, and is kind of a challenge to write, because I usually still even run into problems and have to discover my own workaround solutions to them. I guess that’s just part of being a hacker though... maybe.

Not much else is going on. I got a huge RAM upgrade for my computer (2GB to 8GB) so vmware and the like run at super full speed, which is nice. I guess.

TTYL LOL.
