It's just a small cute little thing really. You will find said cuteness [>>here](http://www.freewebs.com/vgmoose/iPod/Browse.html).

You can enter any website in the box and it will go to it. You can also search the mobile internet (SSR mode). Hitting Home returns you to the URL box, and hitting Sleep/Wake turns it off... which is pointless...

Future things for this, so that it may actually be practical, are drag and drop interface, and the ability for other websites to recognize it as an iPod, allowing it to access the iPod version.

An iPhone skin is also probably soon on its way, and maybe in the further future, will be the ability to turn it, but don't count on it...
