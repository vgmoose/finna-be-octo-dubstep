Hi! It's 2024! Ahh!

Just a quick post sharing some custom labels for [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokémon_Picross_(GBC)](Pokémon Picross (GBC)) and [Crystal Clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMNCrystalClear/).

Resize these to 42mm x 37mm (or 4.2cm x 3.7cm) and print on sticker paper.

The Picross label is made using edited assets from [Pokémon Picross Adventure](https://reliccastle.com/threads/7030/), which itself is using the [3DS version's logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Picross).

The Crystal Clear label is edited from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-clear).

There are a few game boy cartridge labels for these that are available online, but I prefer the more pixelly art style for these mods specifically.
