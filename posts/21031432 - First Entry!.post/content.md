Now, please bear with me. There is no purpose to this blog. I don't even have any plans to share it with anyone. In fact, it's kind of strange that you're even reading this. The only reason I'm posting an entry is to try the Motorola Droid's keyboard out and practice a bit. I've only made a couple of mistakes so far, so that's good. I've decided that it isn't nearly as annoying as I thought it would be; I currently prefer it to the onscreen one and the shift to the left doesn't appear to bother me. Cool. We're all done here. Bye forever.
