<p>This is literally just an update to let you know that I’m still alive! AND YES, THIS IS STILL GOING TO GET DONE EVEN IF IT KILLS ME. I have a chunk of time to work on it on Tuesday, so I think I shall do that then. With any luck, it’ll be finished.</p>
<p>Sorry this time. It’s really just laziness now that I’ve overcome that trainer-in-battle issue. I also installed Windows 7 as a virtual machine as opposed to Windows XP, and I’d like to do another tutorial soon. Maybe even one detailing how to use the GTS to hack Pokémon in the current games.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s all I’ve got. Again, not that it matters, because nobody reads this. But whatever.</p>
