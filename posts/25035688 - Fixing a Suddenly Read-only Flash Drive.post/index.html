<p>A while back I purchased this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZETCQ3/">Silicon Power 64G USB3 flash drive</a> to put on my keychain. It was a great, durable flash drive for about 6 months... Then, it suddenly showed up as read-only on any device that I connected to it!</p>
<p>It was not a permission error, or something wrong with the partition map. The physical device was flat-out refusing to be read. Even gparted -&gt; Create Partition Map would report back "/dev/sdb is read-only".</p>
<p>After some googling, a common belief is that this may be a sign that the drive is on its way out, and that it enters a read-only safemode to allow data to be copied off it without encouraging the user to keep using it. That might actually still be true.</p>
<p>The fact remains though, that something in the USB firmware/controller is preventing writes from occurring at a low level. I eventually came across <a href="https://www.silicon-power.com/web/download-USBrecovery">this program</a> from Silicon Power. It was a rather sketchy program, and it downloaded another program before it ran. But when it did run, it restored the write-ability to my flash drive! So who am I to complain?</p>
<p>I'm making this post as I didn't see a solution like this recommended anywhere where people were complaining about their flash drives suddenly becoming read-only. So to sum up, if this has happened to your flash drive, the manufacturer may provide some (questionable) recovery software to fix the issue! Good luck.</p>
