Well, my aunts asked me to create a website for their Alpaca and farm business, which, although more than happy to do, I doubt basic HTML alone would allow me to do it. This lead me into playing around a bit with PHP, which lead to [this](http://vgmoose.t35.com/calc.html).

PHP is really interesting and simple at the same time, which is nice.
