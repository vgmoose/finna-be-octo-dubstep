<p>...until I lose interest in this blog-dealie. I have reason to suspect that the only reason I've been updating it is because everyone who normally talks to me is off doing something holiday related. It's actually really sad. What can I talk about now? uhhh... Nothing I guess. Now that I have my Droid my iPod Touch is almost completely useless. In fact, even holding it makes me feel childish. ):</p>
