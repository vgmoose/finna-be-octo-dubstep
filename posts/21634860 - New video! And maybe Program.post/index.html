<p>I told you guys that I wasn't dead! And it's all new content too! Kind of...</p>
<p>I mean, it isn't the promised Creepypasta BUT THAT IS PROBABLY BEING WORKED ON.</p>
<p>Your Interactive Adventure can blaaaaaaaagh. Maybe I'll make a fourth generation IA LOLMFAO. No I won't.</p>
<p>Anyway, I intend on doing more fourth generation videos. Then maybe even fifth gen if the process is similar enough.</p>
<p>Also, I had a thought. A program similar to A-text that would edit the fourth generation text (or at the very least in heart gold and soul silver). VGText? Or simply V-text maybe? It's too bad I'd have to make it for Windows... I'm not very familiar with the process, although Visual Basic doesn't look that hard to pick up.</p>
<p>We'll see bros!</p>
<p>PS: I don't know if any of you saw, (you probably didn't), but I tried to make a Tumblr to see if my videos would catch on there with... no success. Oh well. This old standby is fine...</p>
