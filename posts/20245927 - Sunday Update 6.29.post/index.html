<p>You can be expecting a New Pokemon Hack this week. I have the script sitting in a .txt file on my desktop, and I'm just waiting to overcome one small obsticle before I upload it.</p>
<p>In other news, I created a <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/vgmoose/CODE/difficult.html">website</a> that encodes and decodes my secret language known as Moose Code. You do need a password to get in, otherwise it wouldn't be much of a secret :p</p>
<p>Looking foward to seeing some Animal Crossing Wii news at this year's E3 as well...</p>
<p>So yeah, have a nice week everybody. Oh, and I've added a page on my contact info. It will include friend codes, wii codes, etc at a later date.</p>
