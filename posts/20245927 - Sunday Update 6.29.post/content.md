You can be expecting a New Pokemon Hack this week. I have the script sitting in a .txt file on my desktop, and I'm just waiting to overcome one small obsticle before I upload it.

In other news, I created a [website](http://www.freewebs.com/vgmoose/CODE/difficult.html) that encodes and decodes my secret language known as Moose Code. You do need a password to get in, otherwise it wouldn't be much of a secret :p

Looking foward to seeing some Animal Crossing Wii news at this year's E3 as well...

So yeah, have a nice week everybody. Oh, and I've added a page on my contact info. It will include friend codes, wii codes, etc at a later date.
