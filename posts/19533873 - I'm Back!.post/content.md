And just when you thought you were safe! Well, after about 6 months the site is back up. This computer (our laptop) is getting really annoying! It has begun to reset itself, (as in all data go buh-bye), on a daily basis! It's not a trojan, (because one time it did it before we even got on the internet), but it just keeps deleting the required files, and we have to reset the whole thing, (which unfortunately takes 3 hours). I've found my memory stick though, so now I hardly do anything without it!
