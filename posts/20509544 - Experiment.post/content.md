Well, this "blog" nonsense has officially become part of a personal experiment of mine. The experiment? Just how long your average Moose can blog.

I guess I could always tell you about my day... But I don't really DO much so that's kind of a problem...

...

OH! Here's something!! I recently watched Spiderman... for the first time. I never liked Spiderman. I just always thought he was some joke super-hero that just kinda was put out there for the lil' kiddies.

BUT OH MAN, there's SO much more to it than that. He's all NYAA-WHOOSH PUNCH PUNCH JUMP. KILL. Unlike Batman, Spiderman doesn't seem to have any sort of problem with completely killing people. YOU KILL MY UNCLE MAN, I KILL YOU.

Uh, yeah.

Stuff.
