On July 4th, 2016, I released another homebrew app for the Wii U called the Homebrew App Store! [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC8SdRMTidg) of me using it.

Check out the [thread here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-homebrew-app-store.433275/) for information about on how to use it. The source code is available on [my github](https://github.com/vgmoose/hbas).
