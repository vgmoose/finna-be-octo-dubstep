Pokémon Black and white are coming out soon and I did a hacxkkie amajig for them.

I also put up a preliminary fifth gen download link. I included a lot of tools from the fourth gen download that I was familiar with in addition to pptxt, for text editing. 

Also, you all probably have not noticed, but I updated the fourth gen download so that it’s actually useful. It has everything you need in addition to detailed help files. All it’s really missing is a map editor, which doesn’t actually exist at this time so I’m feeling pretty good about that...

Yeeeeeahhhh...
