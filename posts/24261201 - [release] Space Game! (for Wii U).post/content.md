On Feb 9 2016 I released a little homebrew app for the Wii U called Space Game! [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/KMuicPmOIHw) of me playing it.

You can play the game on the latest 5.5.0/5.5.1 Wii U firmwares by going to [space.vgmoose.com](http://space.vgmoose.com/). I've written a couple of posts about it on [gbatemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-space-game.414342/) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/45fc0l/a_homebrew_game_i_made_for_wii_u/). The source code is available on [my github](https://github.com/vgmoose/space).

Please enjoy! I hope to one day make my splash as a real developer on a Nintendo console, but until then, this homebrew stuff is the only card I can play.
