<p>Wow, it looks like this is going to be my first blog post of the year. It's hard to believe that 2017 is going by as quickly as it is. The goal of this post is going to be more of a summary / status on current events / retrospective.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite projects from 2016 were Space Game, Homebrew App Store, and nc-client</p>
