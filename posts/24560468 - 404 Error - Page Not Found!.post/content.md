The resource that you were expecting to see here either is no longer here or never was.

This is bad!!

While I find it very difficult to keep all my older links up and running, I get so very frustrated when some resource on the web I'm looking for 404's. As a result, I've tried to remedy these issues through a series of Javascript redirect tricks and subdomains.

In other words, I'm sorry that you're seeing this page! I would really like to fix all my 404 errors, so please [send me a message](mailto:me@vgmoose.com) telling me the url that 404'd and the page that you were looking for.

Thank you! And I'm serious, please email me: I want to fix this!
