<p>The resource that you were expecting to see here either is no longer here or never was.</p>
<p>This is bad!!</p>
<p>While I find it very difficult to keep all my older links up and running, I get so very frustrated when some resource on the web I'm looking for 404's. As a result, I've tried to remedy these issues through a series of Javascript redirect tricks and subdomains.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm sorry that you're seeing this page! I would really like to fix all my 404 errors, so please <a href="mailto:me@vgmoose.com">send me a message</a> telling me the url that 404'd and the page that you were looking for.</p>
<p>Thank you! And I'm serious, please email me: I want to fix this!</p>
