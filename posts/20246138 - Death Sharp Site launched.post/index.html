<p>As you may or may not know, a couple of neighborhood friends and I happen to be in a band. Well, OK, I just sorta manage it, but still.</p>
<p>The music is pretty good if you ask me. Anyway, I was in charge of the website, but recently, Joey, the head of the band, asked me to take it down. You can still view it <a href="http://deathsharp.2tunes.com/">&gt;&gt;here</a>.</p>
<p>Not one to kill my own work, if you click the "You're Dead" button, you can enter the password to view the site. The password REALLY isn't a tricky one, and it's also easy to find if you look at the page's source...</p>
<p>shhh don't tell Joey that &gt;.&gt;</p>
