As you may or may not know, a couple of neighborhood friends and I happen to be in a band. Well, OK, I just sorta manage it, but still.

The music is pretty good if you ask me. Anyway, I was in charge of the website, but recently, Joey, the head of the band, asked me to take it down. You can still view it [>>here](http://deathsharp.2tunes.com/).

Not one to kill my own work, if you click the "You're Dead" button, you can enter the password to view the site. The password REALLY isn't a tricky one, and it's also easy to find if you look at the page's source...

shhh don't tell Joey that >.>
